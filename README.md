# Basic Lexical Parsing

This program reads the contents of the included `front.in` text
file, and parses the contents as input for a hypothetical mathematical
analysis language.

## To Run
This repository has a makefile written to use the `gcc` compiler.
from the root of the repo, run the command `make all` or `make parser` to compile the program.
Then run it as `./parser`.  To test other inputs, copy them into the 
`front.in` text file.
